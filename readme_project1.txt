 **********************************************************************/
I am thinking of making my project an implementation of the game Snake,
    where the snake grows as it eats more items. The player attempts to get
    the highest score possible by trying to grow their snake as long as
    possible.
    
    The user will use the WASD keys to turn the snake as the user wants.
    
    The program I will make will make use of the generic LinkedList by
    continiously adding Snake Segmenet objects to the Snake as it eats objects.
    I also need objects for the Snake to eat. And perhaps obstacle objects
    to make the game more difficult.
    
    I will test the program by utilizing debugging tools like print statments
    to see if my program is doing what I want and also playing the game myself 
    to see if it runs as expected. I will consider my program successful if it
    is fun to play and runs as expected.
    
    I think the most challenging part of the project may be to update the 
    linkedlist to incorporate the shifting directions the user will enter, and
    how that will be visually represented. The core functionality I can 
    implement quickly is the linked list of the snake and perhaps recognizing
    when it eats something and adding to thelist. 
    
    



/**********************************************************************
 *  What is the point of the interface List?  What does it mean for
 *  a Java class (e.g., LinkedList) to implement an interface?
 **********************************************************************/
The interface List describes the API that the class LinkedList must implement.
    Provides a simple description of what the program can do without full 
    understanding of processes behind it. When a Java class implements 
    an interface, it must implement all the methods outlined in the inteface.



/**********************************************************************
 *  Explain (in no less than 100 words and no more than 200) how your
 *  project plans to use Linked List class?
 **********************************************************************/
I will be using a Snake that will consist of the Linked List class that will
    expand as it eats things.
